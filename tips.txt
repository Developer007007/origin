creating a new repository via the github website and then initializing it as suggested by Github  worked for me

echo "# Secrets" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Developer007007/origin.git
git push -u origin main
